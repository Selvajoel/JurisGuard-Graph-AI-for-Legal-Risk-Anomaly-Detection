# JurisGuard: Graph AI for Legal Risk & Anomaly Detection ⚖️🧠

JurisGuard is an AI-powered, graph-enabled platform that leverages **Knowledge Graphs and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to detect **legal risks, suspicious relationships, and anomalies** across contracts, cases, entities, and compliance data.  
It enables **early, explainable, and scalable legal risk detection** while reducing manual review efforts.

## 📌 About

JurisGuard addresses a critical challenge in legal and compliance domains:  
**legal risk is often hidden in relationships, not isolated documents**.

Traditional legal risk assessment depends on manual reviews and rule-based checks, which are slow, costly, and prone to human error—especially in large organizations.

JurisGuard models legal data as a **graph**, where:
- **Nodes** represent entities such as companies, individuals, contracts, clauses, courts, cases, and policies  
- **Edges** represent relationships such as ownership, agreements, litigation links, payments, and obligations  

Using **Graph AI and anomaly detection**, the system identifies:
- Unusual or hidden relationships  
- Abnormal contract or clause patterns  
- Conflict-of-interest networks  
- Repeated or suspicious compliance violations  
- Emerging risk clusters across matters  

This relational intelligence enables proactive legal risk mitigation.
